aving declared independence, the fledgling American republicbegan raising the military and naval forces necessary to secure it.This proved no mean feat, seeing that colonial military experience
had been more or less restricted to episodic militia actions and periodic pri-vateering. Worse still, whatever forces were raised would be pitted againstthe British army and Royal Navy, which, man for man, were probably thefinest establishments of their kind in the world. American&#x0027;s neophytesendured some very hard knocks at the hands of these highly professionalantagonists. Yet, through the inspired leadership of men like George Wash-ington and Nathanael Greene, coupled with a sizable and essential infu-sion of money, weapons, sea power, and troops from France, Great Britainfailed to overcome the revolution and basically abandoned the effort after1781. The Americans next struggled with exactly what kind of armed estab-lishment they would adopt for their new nation. The initial rush towardcomplete demobilization of the Continental army and navy was politicallyappealing but unrealistic, and small standing forces were grudgingly adoptedunder the new Constitution. Otherwise, America placed its faith in armedcitizen soldiers-the militia. A costly process of trial and error ensued, butthe nascent U.S. Army finally won its spurs in the Northwest Indian War,1790-94, while the U.S. Navy performed capably in the Quasi-War withFrance, 1798-1800, and the Tripolitan War, 1802-05. Still, prevailing politi-cal sensibilities continued placing an inordinate emphasis on state levies,volunteers, and privateers, all of which formed the majority of manpowerdeployed in the second showdown with Great Britain, the War of 1812. Asbefore, this hybrid American army, where both regular forces and militiamenwere hastily trained and poorly led, was embarrassingly bested by smallerBritish forces. It was not until the final year of the conflict that the firstmanifestations of military professionalism began emerging, although far toolate to influence the course of events. Likewise the U.S. Navy, despite animpressive run of individual ship victories, was driven from the sea by thesheer bulk of Royal Navy hulls arrayed against it. The upshot of this secondwar with England served to underscore the lessons of the first, namely, in

wartime there is no safe substitute for sizable regular forces led by professionally trained officers, naval and military alike. Whatever lip service politicians paid to the militia in the postwar period, after 1815 the American polity displayed increasing tolerance for and acceptance of standing forces on the European model.</p>
    <p class = "indent">Three decades lapsed before the nation&#x0027;s next military contest unfolded, and during this time the U.S. Army was mainly absorbed with frontier garrison duties and an occasional Indian conflict. One of these, the Seminole War of 1835-42, would prove to be the most prolonged struggle of its kind waged by the army, but it handled itself well under extremely trying circumstance. The U.S. Navy was similarly deployed in campaigns against piracy throughout the Caribbean and Mediterranean, acquitting itself capably. Both services shone brightly during the brief but bloody Mexican War, 1846-48, affording convincing proof of what relatively small American forces, backed by sizable bodies of volunteers, could achieve under capable leadership. It was here that graduates of the U.S. Military Academy were in abundance for the first time and made an indelible impact upon American combat per- formance-a far cry from the poorly trained cadres of 1812. This quest for institutionalized professionalism further extended itself in 1854 following the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy, just as the newest steam and armament technologies were coming to the fore. Yet neither service could have prepared itself for the struggle that became the Civil War, 1861-65. The sheer magnitude of the theater in question, the length of the coastline covered, and the ultimate manpower totals involved simply dwarfed anything previously experienced by American military planners. In the face of this emergency, North and South alike resurrected the politically expedient practice of recruiting volunteers and state militias to do most of the fighting. However, most of the senior leaders and many regimental-grade officers possessed professional military backgrounds so that, within a year of the war&#x0027;s commencement, Northern and Southern armies were capable of mounting impressive battlefield efforts. Moreover, these were the first military establishments to pioneer new technologies such as locomotives, barbed wire, telegraphs, and-for the first time in America-military drafts on a vast scale. The Union victory was overwhelmingly won by nonprofessional &#x201C;citizen soldiers&#x201D; yet it did not alter the perception that American defense needs were best addressed by small, professional forces in peacetime. These forces could be greatly expanded by drawing upon a vast pool of militia and volunteers in time of war. An American way of war had evolved.</p>
    <p class = "indent">This volume proffers extensive chronological coverage of United States military history from 1775 to 1865, from the Revolutionary War up through the Civil War. Thematically, entries are listed by service, with <i>Military</i> denoting U.S. Army, militia, and National Guard, <i>Naval</i> for U.S. Navy and privateers, and <i>Marines</i> for Continental and U.S. Marines. A handful of other
topical entries such as <i>Diplomacy</i> crop up when necessary for clarification. <i>Aviation</i> entries speak to individual events, as there was not yet a branch of aviation service. Given the vast geographical expanse covered, this volume also delineates military events by a strictly ordered geographical region (East, South, then West), while naval events are listed by Atlantic, Pacific, then rivers. Most entries cover single events, but where two or more military or naval events fall under a given date, they are listed in this strict geographic order for uniformity. Also, the exact locale is spelled out in each entry for clarity. Moreover, the scope of this series is inclusive, and an &#x201C;event&#x201D; might entail coverage of a battle, a noted person&#x0027;s activities, a congressional law, or policy respecting some facet of the army and navy, like the debut of new technology. Space constraints limit most entries to a few lines at best, but significant events may command up to a paragraph in space according to their significance. The text is further enhanced by over 40 capsule biographies of significant military figures (generals, admirals, officers, Native Americans) who deserve a greater context than these citations allow. Finally, a bibliography of all the latest scholarship on U.S. military history is appended, with subdivisions to promote ease of use. By perusing these pages, even a casual reader can grasp the great complexity and richness of the American military experience, which has done so much to influence the history and politics of the nation and the world at large. I am indebted to my editor, Owen Lancer, for accepting this project at my suggestion; it was an arduous endeavor but also a learning experience for which I am much obliged.
