aving declared independence, the fledgling American republicbegan raising the military and naval forces necessary to secure it.This proved no mean feat, seeing that colonial military experience
had been more or less restricted to episodic militia actions and periodic pri-vateering. Worse still, whatever forces were raised would be pitted againstthe British army and Royal Navy, which, man for man, were probably thefinest establishments of their kind in the world. American&#x0027;s neophytesendured some very hard knocks at the hands of these highly professionalantagonists. Yet, through the inspired leadership of men like George Wash-ington and Nathanael Greene, coupled with a sizable and essential infu-sion of money, weapons, sea power, and troops from France, Great Britainfailed to overcome the revolution and basically abandoned the effort after1781. The Americans next struggled with exactly what kind of armed estab-lishment they would adopt for their new nation. The initial rush towardcomplete demobilization of the Continental army and navy was politicallyappealing but unrealistic, and small standing forces were grudgingly adoptedunder the new Constitution. Otherwise, America placed its faith in armedcitizen soldiers-the militia. A costly process of trial and error ensued, butthe nascent U.S. Army finally won its spurs in the Northwest Indian War,1790-94, while the U.S. Navy performed capably in the Quasi-War withFrance, 1798-1800, and the Tripolitan War, 1802-05. Still, prevailing politi-cal sensibilities continued placing an inordinate emphasis on state levies,volunteers, and privateers, all of which formed the majority of manpowerdeployed in the second showdown with Great Britain, the War of 1812. Asbefore, this hybrid American army, where both regular forces and militiamenwere hastily trained and poorly led, was embarrassingly bested by smallerBritish forces. It was not until the final year of the conflict that the firstmanifestations of military professionalism began emerging, although far toolate to influence the course of events. Likewise the U.S. Navy, despite animpressive run of individual ship victories, was driven from the sea by thesheer bulk of Royal Navy hulls arrayed against it. The upshot of this secondwar with England served to underscore the lessons of the first, namely, in
<b>Introduction</b>
wartime there is no safe substitute for sizable regular forces led by professionally trained officers, naval and military alike. Whatever lip service politicians paid to the militia in the postwar period, after 1815 the American polity displayed increasing tolerance for and acceptance of standing forces on the European model.
    Three decades lapsed before the nation&#x0027;s next military contest unfolded, and during this time the U.S. Army was mainly absorbed with frontier garrison duties and an occasional Indian conflict. One of these, the Seminole War of 1835-42, would prove to be the most prolonged struggle of its kind waged by the army, but it handled itself well under extremely trying circumstance. The U.S. Navy was similarly deployed in campaigns against piracy throughout the Caribbean and Mediterranean, acquitting itself capably. Both services shone brightly during the brief but bloody Mexican War, 1846-48, affording convincing proof of what relatively small American forces, backed by sizable bodies of volunteers, could achieve under capable leadership. It was here that graduates of the U.S. Military Academy were in abundance for the first time and made an indelible impact upon American combat per- formance-a far cry from the poorly trained cadres of 1812. This quest for institutionalized professionalism further extended itself in 1854 following the establishment of the U.S. Naval Academy, just as the newest steam and armament technologies were coming to the fore. Yet neither service could have prepared itself for the struggle that became the Civil War, 1861-65. The sheer magnitude of the theater in question, the length of the coastline covered, and the ultimate manpower totals involved simply dwarfed anything previously experienced by American military planners. In the face of this emergency, North and South alike resurrected the politically expedient practice of recruiting volunteers and state militias to do most of the fighting. However, most of the senior leaders and many regimental-grade officers possessed professional military backgrounds so that, within a year of the war&#x0027;s commencement, Northern and Southern armies were capable of mounting impressive battlefield efforts. Moreover, these were the first military establishments to pioneer new technologies such as locomotives, barbed wire, telegraphs, and-for the first time in America-military drafts on a vast scale. The Union victory was overwhelmingly won by nonprofessional &#x201C;citizen soldiers&#x201D; yet it did not alter the perception that American defense needs were best addressed by small, professional forces in peacetime. These forces could be greatly expanded by drawing upon a vast pool of militia and volunteers in time of war. An American way of war had evolved.
    This volume proffers extensive chronological coverage of United States military history from 1775 to 1865, from the Revolutionary War up through the Civil War. Thematically, entries are listed by service, with <i>Military</i> denoting U.S. Army, militia, and National Guard, <i>Naval</i> for U.S. Navy and privateers, and <i>Marines</i> for Continental and U.S. Marines. A handful of other
topical entries such as <i>Diplomacy</i> crop up when necessary for clarification. <i>Aviation</i> entries speak to individual events, as there was not yet a branch of aviation service. Given the vast geographical expanse covered, this volume also delineates military events by a strictly ordered geographical region (East, South, then West), while naval events are listed by Atlantic, Pacific, then rivers. Most entries cover single events, but where two or more military or naval events fall under a given date, they are listed in this strict geographic order for uniformity. Also, the exact locale is spelled out in each entry for clarity. Moreover, the scope of this series is inclusive, and an &#x201C;event&#x201D; might entail coverage of a battle, a noted person&#x0027;s activities, a congressional law, or policy respecting some facet of the army and navy, like the debut of new technology. Space constraints limit most entries to a few lines at best, but significant events may command up to a paragraph in space according to their significance. The text is further enhanced by over 40 capsule biographies of significant military figures (generals, admirals, officers, Native Americans) who deserve a greater context than these citations allow. Finally, a bibliography of all the latest scholarship on U.S. military history is appended, with subdivisions to promote ease of use. By perusing these pages, even a casual reader can grasp the great complexity and richness of the American military experience, which has done so much to influence the history and politics of the nation and the world at large. I am indebted to my editor, Owen Lancer, for accepting this project at my suggestion; it was an arduous endeavor but also a learning experience for which I am much obliged.

<p class = ""><b><i>January 27</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading"><p class = "side-heading">Military: Secretary of State for the Colonies William Legge, Lord Dartmouth, instructs General Thomas Gage in Boston to take whatever measures are necessary to enforce the Crown&#x0027;s authority. At this time, Gage commands a garrison force of nine regiments and five Royal Artillery companies, for a total of 4,000 well-trained troops. Four large warships in the harbor contribute a further 460 Royal Marines under Major John Pitcairn.
<p class = ""><b><i>February 20</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The Second Provincial Congress reconvenes at Concord, Massachusetts, and takes positive steps to enhance colonial defenses. These include establishment of a military commissary, the recruitment of Stockbridge Indians, rules for military governance, and an appeal to neighboring colonies for reinforcements and supplies.
<p class = ""><b><i>February 26</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: In Boston, General Thomas Gage orders a cache of colonial supplies and cannon stored at Salem, Massachusetts, to be seized by force. The 64th Foot, under Colonel Alexander Leslie, lands at Marblehead, Massachusetts, and proceeds inland. En route, Leslie&#x0027;s path is blocked by irate civilians and militia, who refuse him passage over a drawbridge. Leslie makes preparations to fire on his antagonists when a deputation under Colonel Timothy Pickering agrees to allow the British across, but only on the condition that they examine the building in question, then depart. Leslie, outnumbered and wishing to avoid a fight, complies. The British cross the bridge, examine the building in question, then retire and sail back to Boston. Henceforth the affair is derided by colonials as &#x201C;Leslie&#x0027;s Retreat,&#x201D; which further emboldens them to confront the Redcoats.
<p class = ""><b><i>March 23</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The extralegal Virginia Convention of Delegates, aroused by recent events in Massachusetts, begins debating defensive measures. At length, outspoken politician Patrick Henry gains appointment as colonel of the 1st Virginia Regiment. He also rails against Governor John Murray, Lord Dunmore&#x0027;s suspension of the assembly and thunders, &#x201C;Forbid it, Almighty God-I know not what course others may take; but as for me-give me liberty or give me death!&#x201D;
<p class = ""><b><i>March 25</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: In an ominous development for Great Britain, the Virginia Convention mandates that each county will raise, equip, and train a company of infantry or cavalry.
<p class = ""><b><i>March 30</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Royal Governor Thomas Gage sends a brigade of 1,200 British soldiers under Colonel Hugh Percy on a foray out of Boston and along the Charles River in a show of strength. Local militia do not contest this movement but assume defensive positions at the river crossings; the Redcoats, seeking to avoid a fight, simply march back into town without incident.
<p class = ""><b><i>April</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Escalating tensions culminate in creation of the Provisional Army by the extralegal Provincial Congress in Massachusetts. This 30,000-man force is to consist of detachments from all six New England states, supplemented by British cannon seized from various forts. Concord, New Hampshire, is selected as the major entrepot for the force, and detachments begin drifting in from New Hampshire, Connecticut, and Rhode Island.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 1</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The New York assembly requires all males of military age to enlist in the militia.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 5</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The Massachusetts Provincial Congress adopts 52 articles of war, principally derived from the 1765 British Articles of War, in the event of hostilities. The preamble carefully delineates the colony&#x0027;s denial of rebellion or treason and reiterates a long list of complaints against the British government.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 14</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Thomas Gage again receives positive instructions from Secretary of State for the Colonies William Legge, Lord Dartmouth, authorizing him to employ military force to secure compliance with the Coercive Acts, including the arrest of colonial leaders. However, Gage&#x0027;s request for 20,000 reinforcements has been turned down as impractical at that time.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 15</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Thomas Gage, declining to arrest colonial leaders, prepares a picked force of 700 light infantry and grenadiers (flank companies) to make another &#x201C;powder raid&#x201D; against Concord and Worcester, Massachusetts. He rejects orders to arrest colonial leaders as impractical and opts instead for a preemptive strike against a military objective. The Redcoats are to be conveyed by longboat across the Charles River in darkness and begin their night march in silence. However, colonial intelligence is tipped off as to their arrival and destination, and numerous riders are sent galloping off to arouse the countryside.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 16</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Dr. Joseph Warren readies dispatch rider Paul Revere to gallop from Boston to Lexington, Massachusetts, to warn John Hancock and Samuel Adams
of the British army&#x0027;s approach. The warning eventually spreads to Worcester, where the local militia successfully relocates all military supplies stored there. Revere also arranges for lanterns to be hung from the steeple of the Old North Church to signal the British route taken: one lamp if by land, two if by sea.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 18</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: At night, a British column of 70 picked light troops and grenadiers under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith and Major John Pitcairn departs Boston, is ferried across the Charles River at Lechmere Point in great secrecy, and begins the overland march toward Concord. The colonists are prepared for such an occurrence, and Paul Revere and William Dawes ride off to warn the militia-and colonial leaders John Hancock and Samuel Adams. Both riders are caught and detained by the British, and it falls upon Dr. Samuel Prescott to deliver the actual message.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 19</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The British column under Lieutenant Colonel Francis Smith trudges along in the darkness from Boston to Concord as church bells peal through the night, denoting their approach. At length, the light infantry is detached ahead of the main force under Major John Pitcairn to scout the village of Lexington, Massachusetts. There they find Captain John Parker&#x0027;s company of 70 minutemen deployed on the local green off to the side. An angry Pitcairn rides up to them and orders them to disperse at once. To defuse a possible confrontation, Parker is in the act of complying when a musket shot suddenly rings out of nowhere. The tired British, feeling themselves under attack, suddenly open fire against orders, killing eight militiamen and wounding nine. It takes Pitcairn several minutes to restore order in the ranks, but a war has begun. The British re-form their ranks and continue on to their objective, six miles distant. Within the hour, the balance of Colonel Francis Smith&#x0027;s column arrives at Lexington and proceeds to its main objective at Concord. There, his grenadiers search the premises for stored weapons, long removed by militia under Colonel James Barrett, and they also set fire to a courthouse and several buildings. Meanwhile, a detachment of light infantry under Captain Walter Laurie, sent to guard the North Bridge, is engaged by colonial militia and driven off, losing three killed and eight wounded. His mission complete, Smith then turns his force around and tramps back to Boston. En route, his march is continually intercepted and assailed by throngs of angry militiamen under General William Heath who rake the column with galling musketry from behind rocks, trees, and all available cover. The British take fearful losses while Smith is wounded and Pitcairn unhorsed. They are almost overwhelmed when a column under Colonel Hugh Percy suddenly reinforces them at Lexington. Percy then skillfully conducts a withdrawal under fire and at the last minute redirects his escape route toward Charleston instead of Cambridge, a ploy that most likely saved his army. The 1,800 British engaged lose 73 killed and 201 wounded on this momentous day; of roughly 3,800 Americans present, the toll reaches 49 dead and 94 injured. The incredible news quickly spreads throughout the colonies, and a violent upheaval against continuing British rule finally congeals.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Artemas Ward assumes command of the Provincial Army gathering at Cambridge, Massachusetts, with Generals William Heath and John Thomas his principal subordinates. Their 13,000 men slowly envelop Boston from the land side, unofficially besieging it. In a celebrated ride, General Israel Putnam gallops in from Connecticut, covering 100 miles in only 18 hours.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 21</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: New Hampshire militiamen under Colonel John Stark arrive at Cambridge, Massachusetts, in the wake of Lexington and Concord.

• Colonial forces begin seizing powder supplies and arms from British depots in Charleston, South Carolina.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 23</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The Massachusetts Provincial Congress in Concord calls for a New England &#x201C;Army of Observation&#x201D; so as not to appear excessively hostile against the
British Crown. The army has an authorized strength of 30,000 volunteers, including 13,000 local troops under General Artemas Ward, who is joined by Generals William Heath, John Thomas, Joseph Warren, and John Whitcomb. No time is wasted dispatching messengers to neighboring colonies with pleas for immediate reinforcement. Additional forces begin arriving under Generals Nathanael Greene of Rhode Island and Israel Putnam of Connecticut.
• When word of the fighting at Lexington and Concord reaches New York City, a party of militiamen under Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willet storms the public arsenal and seizes weapons stored there.
<p class = ""><b><i>April 28</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Colonel Ethan Allen and a group of the Green Mountain Boys arrive at Castleton, Vermont, to debate seizing the stores and munitions kept at Fort Ticonderoga, New York.

<p class = ""><b><i>May 2</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Colonel Patrick Henry directs colonial forces toward Williamsburg, where they recapture powder and other supplies taken from the militia by Governor John Murray, Lord Dunmore. The governor is forced to compensate the colony for any property confiscated.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 3</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Connecticut militia officer Benedict Arnold prevails upon the Committee of Safety in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to provide forces for a preemptive strike against Fort Ticonderoga, New York, and secure a valuable cache of cannon and supplies stored there. Arnold, who is subsequently commissioned a colonel in the Massachusetts militia, receives authority to raise 400 men for the expedition, which promises to net 50 cannon and 20 brass pieces for the Patriot cause.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 5</i></b></p>
Naval: The 16-gun sloop HMS <i>Falcon</i> under Captain John Linzee captures an American sloop off Martha&#x0027;s Vineyard, Massachusetts. Linzee then anchors at the town of Dartmouth to seize another vessel at dockside, but his presence prompts the townspeople to launch two sloops against him, and both prizes are promptly recaptured. The <i>Falcon</i> escapes but loses 15 prisoners.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 8</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: A force of 100 Green Mountain Boys under Colonel Ethan Allen departs Castleton, Vermont, intent upon seizing the cannon and stores held at Fort Ticonderoga, New York. When he meets Colonel Benedict Arnold en route, the two headstrong leaders grudgingly agree to coordinate their movements.
• News of the Battles of Lexington and Concord induces the South Carolina assembly to authorize two infantry regiments and a force of rangers.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 9-10</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: A colonial force of 83 men under Colonels Benedict Arnold and Ethan Allen crosses Lake Champlain in two barges, under cover of a rainstorm, and
surprises the garrison at Fort Ticonderoga, New York. The Americans quickly clamber over the crumbling southern wall and overpower two sentries. When a British officer, Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham, 26th Foot, demands to know by what authority the Americans enter His Majesty&#x0027;s fort, Allen bellows, &#x201C;Come on out of there, you British sons of whores, or I&#x0027;ll smoke you out!&#x201D; The garrison commander, Captain William De la Place, is badly outnumbered and capitulates without resistance. Thus the unlikely pair of Allen and Arnold successfully conclude America&#x0027;s first offensive operation of the war.
Naval: Captain Henry Mowat of the sloop HMS <i>Canceau</i> comes ashore to confer with the inhabitants of Falmouth (Portland), Maine, and is taken prisoner. He escapes soon after but will return in a few months with a vengeance.
Marines: A group of Massachusetts soldiers under Colonel Benedict Arnold seizes a British schooner at Skenesboro (Whitehall), New York, renaming it <i>Liberty.</i> Several soldiers then serve on board as marines, the first instance of such troops in the Revolutionary War.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 11-12</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: A force of Green Mountain Boys under Lieutenant Colonel Seth Warner moves up from Fort Ticonderoga and captures Crown Point, New York, along with another 100 cannon for the Patriot cause. With the southern portion of Lake Champlain in their hands, the Americans are well poised to launch an expedition northward into Canada.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Artemas Ward, in a calculated show of force, parades his ragtag &#x201C;Army of Observation&#x201D; within gunshot of British lines outside of Boston, eliciting no hostile response. He then provocatively deploys 3,000 men on Charlestown Heights, astride Boston Harbor. Again the British fail to react, so Ward withdraws his men to the mainland without incident.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 15-16</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: In Philadelphia, a committee of the Second Continental Congress, of which Virginia delegate George Washington is a member, begins drawing up plans for the defense of New York City.

<p class = ""><b><i>May 17-18</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Colonel Benedict Arnold boards a captured schooner at Skenesboro (Whitehall), New York, and sails to Saint Johns, Quebec, with 50 soldiers. That post and its 15-man garrison quickly succumb, along with the 16-gun sloop HMS <i>George III</i> and four boats. Hastening back to Ticonderoga, Arnold encounters Colonel Ethan Allen and 60 Green Mountain Boys headed north, apparently intent upon occupying the fort. Disregarding Arnold&#x0027;s warnings, Allen approaches Fort Saint Johns only to find it hastily reoccupied by 200 British soldiers and six cannon from neighboring Chambly. The Americans are quickly driven off after losing three prisoners.
Naval: A British supply sloop captured on Lake Champlain by Colonel Benedict Arnold is christened <i>Enterprise</i>; this is the first American vessel to carry that illustrious name.
• Captain James Mugford, commanding the sloop <i>Franklin,</i> captures the British transport HMS <i>Hope</i> off Boston Harbor. Its cargo of 1,000 barrels of gunpowder and a like number of muskets is hastily forwarded to the &#x201C;Army of Observation&#x201D; outside Boston.
Marines: On Lake Champlain, Lieutenant James Wilson becomes the first known marine officer.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 21</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: To alleviate supply shortages, General Thomas Gage authorizes forage parties to land on various islands in Boston Harbor. However, when a party of troops ventures upon Grape Island, many inhabitants gather into three boats and land there to oppose them. The British withdraw before violence flares.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 25</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The British garrison at Boston is reinforced by the arrival of 2,500 men under Generals John Burgoyne, William Howe, and Henry Clinton. General Thomas Gage now commands a highly trained force of 6,500 men, but the presence of three additional generals bespeaks strong government displeasure over his handling of affairs.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 26</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Artemas Ward orders 30 militiamen under Colonel John Nixon to confiscate livestock on Noddle&#x0027;s and Hog Islands in Boston Harbor.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: The Continental Congress authorizes General George Washington to appoint a commissary of artillery stores as a means of securing cannon and the requisite supplies.
• Admiral Samuel Graves orders a contingent of 40 Royal Marines to Noddle&#x0027;s Island, Boston Harbor, to attack the American detachment foraging there. The schooner HMS <i>Diana</i> under Lieutenant Thomas Graves, the admiral&#x0027;s nephew, is also dispatched to cut off the American retreat. Generals Isaac Putnam and Joseph Warren counter by rushing in 1,000 reinforcements of their own and two cannon. Heavy skirmishing results in the destruction of the <i>Diana</i> after it runs aground, and the British withdraw. The fracas proves a rather noisy affair, and both sides suffer only four casualties apiece.
<p class = ""><b><i>May 31</i></b></p>
Politics: Mayhem erupts in Philadelphia after Congress votes to abandon Forts Ticonderoga and Crown Point, New York, over strenuous objections by delegates from New York and New England. At length they reverse themselves and order the posts held as possible conduits for an invasion of Canada.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 2</i></b></p>
Naval: The British cutter HMS <i>Margaretta</i> drops anchor off Machias, Maine, while escorting two timber sloops, <i>Polly</i> and <i>Unity.</i> Their mission is to secure lumber supplies for the British army in Boston. Ichabod Jones, a Loyalist merchant, is then rowed ashore to arrange the purchase. He assures the inhabitants that the wood is not going to be used to build fortifications in Boston, but they remain skeptical and uncooperative.
Politics: The Massachusetts Provincial Congress formally requests that the Continental Congress assume command and responsibility for the burgeoning New England army outside Boston, as it has been raised for the benefit of all Americans. Congress dithers on the offer but does muster the resolve to authorize a pay department for the nascent Continental army.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 5</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: A mob ransacks the colonial arsenal in Williamsburg, Virginia, making off with 400 muskets.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Once the British begin evacuating New York, Lieutenant Colonel Marinus Willett, backed by the Sons of Liberty, stops and seizes five wagons suspected of smuggling weapons out of the city. The Provincial Congress, feeling this violates a previous agreement with the British, orders the weapons returned, but the request is ignored.
Naval: A rancorous town meeting held at Machias, Maine, votes to allow Loyalist merchant Ichabod Jones to purchase lumber for the British in Boston. To further coax cooperation, Midshipman James Moore maneuvers his four-gun schooner HMS <i>Margaretta</i> into a bombardment position offshore.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Guy Carleton, governor-general of Canada, declares martial law in that province, suspends all administrative provisions of the Quebec Act for the time being, and begins recruiting volunteers to augment his understrength forces. Carleton realizes he lacks the resources to deter a serious invasion attempt from the south, so goes on the defensive.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 10</i></b></p>
Politics: As military confrontation with Great Britain looks increasingly inevitable, Massachusetts delegate John Adams lends support to creation of a Continental army to expedite the war.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 11</i></b></p>
Naval: Loyalist merchant Ichabod Jones again comes ashore at Machias, Maine, to purchase lumber for British troops in Boston. Heated debate continues among the townspeople, who finally agree to sell lumber to Jones. However, when he is suddenly seized and imprisoned by Patriots, Midshipman James Moore anchors HMS <i>Margaretta</i> offshore and threatens to bombard the town if Jones is hurt or his vessel attacked. A mob nevertheless seizes the British transports <i>Unity</i> and <i>Polly</i> and demands that Moore surrender. Instead, he cuts his cable and slips downstream to safety.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 12</i></b></p>
Naval: The first naval action of the Revolutionary War occurs when 40 armed lumbermen under Jeremiah O’Brien sail the captured transports <i>Unity</i> and <i>Polly</i> against HMS <i>Margaretta</i> off Machias, Maine. Once adverse winds cripple the
latter&#x0027;s sails, the Americans pull alongside and board, seizing the vessel in a stiff fight. Midshipman James Moore is fatally wounded in the struggle, and the British suffer eight killed and five wounded to an American tally of three killed and two wounded. The <i>Margaretta</i> becomes the first Royal Navy vessel captured by the Americans and its guns are transferred to the <i>Unity,</i> which is renamed <i>Machias Liberty.</i>
• The state of Rhode Island commissions two armed sloops, the first such vessels approved by public authority.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 14</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Thomas Gage falls under increasing pressure from subordinates William Howe, John Burgoyne, and Henry Clinton to take some kind of offensive action and secure greater &#x201C;elbow room&#x201D; for the Boston garrison. He reluctantly agrees to seize strategic Dorchester Heights, still vacant, before moving on to Roxbury and Charlestown Heights. When that is accomplished, the British will be at liberty to launch an overland assault upon rebel headquarters at Cambridge, Massachusetts.
• The Continental Congress votes to raise 10 companies of riflemen, two each from Maryland and Virginia, and six from Pennsylvania. These constitute the nucleus of the rapidly forming Continental army, and a committee, including George Washington and Philip Schuyler, is tasked with drawing up regulations to govern it. Congress also assumes direct control of all colonial forces gathered outside of Boston, at the behest of the Provincial Congress. For all these reasons, this day is considered the birthday of the U.S. Army.
<p class = ""><b><i>June 15</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: The extensive network of colonial spies alerts the Committee of Safety in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that General Thomas Gage intends to seize the high ground on Dorchester Heights outside Boston. They react by ordering General Artemas Ward to preempt the move by occupying Bunker Hill on the Charlestown peninsula.
• John Adams of Massachusetts, wishing to cement Virginia to the revolutionary cause, nominates fellow delegate George Washington to serve as &#x201C;General &#x0026; Commander in Chief of American forces.&#x201D; Resplendent in the blue and buff uniform of the Fairfax County militia, the imposing, austere Washington inspires confidence and is one of the few senior leaders with actual military experience. Unknown at the time, this proves to be one of the most fortuitous appointments in military history. Congress also authorizes creation of four major generals and five brigadiers to lead the rapidly forming Continental army.
Naval: In another early encounter, two Rhode Island vessels under Captain Abraham Whipple capture a British tender belonging to the frigate HMS <i>Rose</i> on the Providence River. Whipple&#x0027;s vessel <i>Katy</i> is eventually acquired by the Continental navy and renamed <i>Providence.</i>
<p class = ""><b><i>June 16</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Throughout the night, Colonel Richard Gridley, the Continental army&#x0027;s chief engineering officer, directs construction of fortifications on Breed&#x0027;s Hill overlooking Boston Harbor. His men dig furiously, constructing a large redoubt on the
<b>Washington, George (1732-1799)</b>
<i>American military officer, first president of the United States</i>
George Washington was born in Westmoreland County, Virginia, on February 22, 1732, and was a part of the minor landed gentry. Although poorly educated, he found work as a surveyor and land speculator, and in 1753 he commenced his long association with military affairs by gaining a militia commission. In this capacity he helped precipitate the bloody French and Indian War by building Fort Necessity on land claimed by France, then surrendering it to superior forces on May 28, 1754. Washington subsequently accompanied the ill-fated expedition of English general Edward Braddock and survived the crushing defeat on the Monon- gahela River on July 9, 1755. After the war, Washington married wealthy Martha Custis and entered colonial politics. A moderate by inclination, he opposed the taxation policies of Great Britain and sided with the Patriots when the Revolutionary War broke out in 1775. Washington, by dint of his military experience, commanding figure, and trust
worthy persona, was chosen to head the new Continental army. He proved successful in forcing the British to evacuate Boston, Massachusetts, but was roundly defeated by them near New York City and forced into a midwinter retreat through New Jersey. It appeared that the Revolution might have ended then and there, but Washington suddenly turned and attacked, defeating the British and their Hessian allies at Trenton and Princeton in December 1776 and January 1777, respectively. Thereafter, while Washington continued to lose a number of battles, he and his men invariably improved their battlefield performance; as long as the Continental army survived intact, so would the American Revolution.
    The impasse continued for many years until the summer of 1781, when Washington was apprised that the French navy would be operating in Chesapeake Bay. Assisted by his French ally, the comte de Rocham- beau, Washington led a lightning march from
hilltop before the British can react, and are subsequently reinforced by 1,200 men under Colonel William Prescott and General Israel Putnam. In the early morning hours, they are joined by small groups of soldiers under Colonel Thomas Knowl- ton, Colonel John Stark, and General Seth Pomeroy, all fighting as volunteers.
• George Washington accepts the nomination as commander in chief, but declines a salary, asking only for a stipend to cover expenses. Charles Lee, Israel Putnam, Philip J. Schuyler, and Artemas Ward are also commissioned major generals. Congress concurrently throws itself into formalizing the new Continental army by establishing unit types and strengths, and authorizing the appointment of an engineer, adjutant general, paymaster, commissary general, and quartermaster.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: At dawn, General Thomas Gage is amazed to behold a complex series of earthworks that have miraculously sprung up overnight at Charlestown, Massachusetts. The danger they pose to the Boston garrison finally rouses him to
New York that trapped British forces under General Charles Cornwallis at Yorktown, Virginia, and forced them to surrender on October 19, 1781. Victory here all but ended the war, and afterward Washington, still the nation&#x0027;s most trusted figure, gradually advocated discarding the Articles of Confederation in favor of more centralized governance under the proposed Constitution. This became a reality in 1789, whereupon Washington was elected the nation&#x0027;s first president and commander in chief. Thus situated, he guided the shaky new republic with a firm hand, stabilizing political institutions, and appointed General Anthony Wayne to defeat the Northwest Indians of Ohio. In 1794 he surmounted another military crisis when disgruntled farmers in western Pennsylvania rebelled rather than pay taxes on whiskey. In his farewell address, the lofty leader cautioned against entangling alliances abroad and then retired to his estate at Mount Vernon. Washington died there on December 14, 1799, a capable military leader and widely mourned as the &#x201C;father of his country.&#x201D;

fight. After further consultation, he resolves that a direct display of British military prowess is necessary to cow the rebels into submission. Gage authorizes 2,200 soldiers under General William Howe to land on the peninsula and drive the rebels off by a frontal assault. Given the low regard that professional British officers hold for their adversaries, no particular difficulty is anticipated. Howe&#x0027;s force then rows across the harbor in barges, and he draws up his command in full battle array before advancing upon the American line as if on parade. Exercising superb fire control, Colonel John Stark and William Prescott allow the vaunted Redcoats to advance within 60 paces before unleashing a devastating, point-blank volley. The attackers are staggered by heavy losses, especially among company-grade officers, and flee back down the slopes. An assault on the American right by General Robert Pigot is likewise rebuffed with many casualties. Stunned by the resistance, Howe rallies the survivors and leads them back up the hill a second time. As before, the precise, closely ordered British lines
approach to within a few yards of American lines before being scythed down by torrents of accurate musketry. Howe&#x0027;s entire staff has been shot down beside him, yet he is miraculously unhurt. He then resolves on a final assault to settle matters with cold steel and orders his men to drop their 80-pound backpacks. He is also reinforced by 400 men under General Henry Clinton and a battalion of Royal Marines under Major John Pitcairn. Once again the British tramp up the steep slopes of Breed&#x0027;s Hill in perfect formation, no mean task considering the steep terrain and intense summer heat, and close with the defenders. By this time the Americans have nearly exhausted their supply of ammunition. Their next volley staggers the attackers but fails to stop them. Howe, sword in hand, then leads them over the parapet and into the redoubt. A vicious hand- to-hand struggle erupts along the line as the American defense collapses under the weight of vengeful bayonets. Clinton, against orders, also pitches into the fray, and General Israel Putnam finally orders a retreat back to the mainland. The fighting suddenly ceases and the exhausted British decline to pursue. Howe has lost 226 killed and 828 wounded, an appalling 48 percent of forces engaged. American losses are noted as 140 dead (including Dr. Joseph Warren) and 271 wounded. An additional 30 prisoners, principally wounded, are also taken. General Henry Clinton, surveying the carnage, considers the battle &#x201C;a dear bought victory, another such would have ruined us.&#x201D;

He seizes 41 cannon and 500 captives, among whom is a youthful Captain John Andre, later to become a celebrated spy: Montgomery immediately paroles them rather than use up his already scanty food stocks. The advance to Montreal is now open, but the delays incurred at Saint Johns have wasted two months of good weather; the Americans must now conduct operations in the dead of winter. Naval: The naval committee votes to purchase, arm, and rename eight merchant vessels as the core of the new Continental navy. They are the <i>Alfred,</i> 24 guns; <i>Columbus,</i> 18 guns; <i>Andrew Doria,</i> 14 guns; <i>Cabot,</i> 14 guns; <i>Providence,</i> 12 guns; <i>Hornet,</i> 10 guns; and <i>Fly,</i> eight guns.

It also prescribes the first official military uniform, consisting of a brown coat with various regiments denoted by collar and cuff colors. Unit esprit de corps is further enhanced by granting each regiment its own distinct set of colors (flags). Total strength is theoretically set at 20,372 soldiers, but the Americans will be lucky to maintain half that in the field at any given time.
<p class = ""><b><i>November 5</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Disregarding the onset of winter, General Richard Montgomery hurriedly presses onward from Saint Johns and marches for Montreal, Quebec.

Governor-General Guy Carleton, surveying the ragtag forces before him, promptly declines the request, at which point the Americans commence an ineffectual bombardment of the town. Carleton&#x0027;s strategy is to allow harsh winter conditions to eviscerate the Americans while awaiting his own reinforcements from Europe.
• Colonel Henry Knox departs Fort Ticonderoga, New York, and begins a perilous midwinter transit back to Boston. At this time, his artillery train consists of 40 sleds drawn by 80 oxen.

Rather than outflank his adversary, Dunmore impatiently orders Captain Samuel Leslie to storm the bridge head on with his grenadier company. Woodford orders his men to lie low, as if the position is undefended, and the British rush up only to receive sudden and accurate fire from concealed troops. Heavily repulsed, Dunmore orders a second charge, which is also defeated, with a loss of 13 dead and 49 wounded to one American injured. As the British are in the act of withdrawing, Woodford suddenly sorties across the bridge, trapping Dunmore behind some fortifications.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Outnumbered, short on supplies, and faced with expiring enlistments, General Richard Montgomery and Colonel Benedict Arnold launch a desperate attack on the 1,800-man garrison of Governor-General Guy Carleton during a howling blizzard. Montgomery personally leads the charge against a fortified position and is among the first killed by enemy fire; he is the first American general to die in combat. Arnold&#x0027;s 600-man column enjoys better success and overruns several enemy positions, but he is wounded in the leg and evacuated. His successor, Major Daniel Morgan, continues attacking the barricades and enjoys minor success but is ultimately surrounded and forced to surrender. The Americans sustain 30 dead, 42 injured, and 425 captured to a British tally of only five killed and 13 wounded. Arnold then gathers up his surviving soldiers and reestablishes a loose siege of the city.

The attack flounders, Macleod is killed along with 30 soldiers, and 850 prisoners are secured. The Americans suffer one dead and one injured in the three-minute affair.

<b>Barry, John (1745-1803)</b>
<i>American naval officer</i>
John Barry was born in County Wexford, Ireland, on January 1, 1745, and he went to sea as a cabin boy at the age of 10. After settling in Philadelphia in 1761, he gained prominence as a sea captain and acquired a minor fortune. Once the Revolutionary War commenced in April 1775, Barry donated his vessel <i>Black Prince</i> to the nascent Continental navy, where it was converted into the armed brig <i>Alfred.</i> Barry himself was commissioned a captain in that force as of March 1776, commanding the brig <i>Lexington,</i> and with it he secured the tender HMS <i>Edward</i> on April 6, 1776-the first victory on blue water for the United States. He then captained a succession of vessels, including the frigate <i>Effingham,</i> which he subsequently scuttled to prevent capture. Barry also found time to lead a gun crew at the Battle of Princeton in January 1777, and he later led a boat expedition into Delaware Bay that netted several British supply vessels. In September 1778, Barry embarked on
the frigate <i>Raleigh,</i> but he was cornered by two British warships and driven ashore near

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General John Thomas arrives outside Quebec as the new commander in chief of American forces stationed there. After replacing General Wooster,
Penobscot, Maine. He next served capably while commanding a brig in the Pennsylvania state navy while awaiting a new Continental warship to be built. These were in short supply, and it was not until February 1780 that his friend General Henry Knox used his influence to secure the new frigate <i>Alliance</i> for him.
    Barry&#x0027;s first voyage on the <i>Alliance</i> proved memorable; while conveying diplomats Thomas Paine and John Laurens to France, he captured several privateers and prizes en route. On April 2, 1780, during the return leg of the voyage, Barry was attacked by the British privateers <i>Minerva</i> and <i>Mars</i> and, through adroit maneuvering, captured both. Another stiff action occurred on May 23, 1780, when the British warships <i>Atalanta</i> and <i>Trepassy</i> were rowed behind the <i>Alliance&#x0027;s</i> stern in a dead wind and raked it repeatedly. Barry, badly wounded yet tenacious as ever, demanded to be carried topside and, when the wind suddenly sprang up, he captured both his antagonists. In the fall of 1781 he was cho
sen to convey the marquis de Lafayette to France, then provide escort to a merchantman carrying millions of dollars in specie. On March 10, 1783, <i>Alliance</i> was attacked by no less than three British vessels, but he completely outsailed his adversaries and badly crippled HMS <i>Sybil.</i> This was the last naval engagement of the Revolutionary War and a surprising American triumph. Afterward, Barry resumed his career with the merchant marine until March 1794, when he was commissioned the senior officer of the new U.S. Navy and tasked with overseeing construction of the new 44-gun frigate <i>United States.</i> Afterward, he led several cruises of the Caribbean during the Quasi-War with France, and on February 3, 1799, he captured a large privateer off Martinique. Barry finally resigned from active duty in 1801 on the grounds of poor health and retired to Philadelphia. He died there on September 13, 1803, a harsh yet capable naval leader. Like John Paul Jones, Barry shares his reputation as &#x201C;Father of the U.S. Navy.&#x201D;
he inherits a force of 1,900 ragged, underfed men and prepares to abandon the siege of that city. Governor-General Guy Carleton, meanwhile, bides his time and awaits reinforcements.

Parker draws up a double line of eight warships mounting 260 guns and bombards the fort for 10 hours. However, the unique properties of the fort&#x0027;s palmetto logs enable them to absorb the British shot with little harm done to the defenders.

General George Washington personally rides up to stem the tide and is nearly captured before General Israel Putnam arrives with help.

NAVAL: General Benedict Arnold&#x0027;s ramshackle flotilla of 15 small vessels is attacked by a large British armada on Lake Champlain near Valcour Island. Arnold has sequestered his force in shallow water between the island and the shore, where the prevailing wind blows southerly. The British under Lieutenant Thomas Pringle initially sail past the Americans, then have to beat back against the wind in order to engage them. This places them squarely in Arnold&#x0027;s defensive arc, and they are pummeled by cannon fire. The British lose heavily while closing but gradually overpower their opponents, sinking two vessels. Arnold then draws off under the cover of darkness with his remaining 13 craft, having lost 200 men wounded, killed, or captured.

As the British struggle ashore they are attacked by Colonel Edward Hand and his Pennsylvania riflemen, who thwart their attempts to storm across a bridge to the mainland. An additional 1,800 Americans then arrive, bottling up Cornwallis along the beach for the next six days. This action buys General George Washington additional time to evacuate his army from New York City.

This is one of the most telling decisions of the Revolutionary War, for it grants the tottering American defenders an eight-month respite to strengthen themselves.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General William Howe, anxious to end the impasse at New York and catch General George Washington in the act of withdrawing, dispatches Generals Henry Clinton and Charles Cornwallis around the American flank by landing at Pell&#x0027;s Point (New Rochelle). Once the British successfully storm ashore, they are met by Colonel John Glover&#x0027;s veteran brigade of 750 men, stoutly posted behind a succession of stone walls. For several hours, every time the British attempt to close, the Americans rise up from behind cover and pour in devastating volleys at close range. The Redcoats fall back in confusion to regroup before pressing ahead. After several hours of combat, Cornwallis finally manages to slip a force around Glover&#x0027;s flank and threaten his rear. The Americans then fall back in good order to Dobb&#x0027;s Ferry and rejoin the main army. Glover&#x0027;s losses are negligible while the British admit to only three killed and 20 wounded. The action at Pell&#x0027;s Point is significant in that it prevents Washington&#x0027;s main force from being attacked as it evacuates New York City; Glover is subsequently thanked by Washington in person for a splendid rearguard action against steep odds.

The Americans occupy a three-mile line behind the shallow Bronx River, arrayed in three divisions. Howe promptly advances upon them, driving the advance guard of General Joseph Spencer before him. The British then parade themselves dauntingly before the defenders, whereupon Washington divines that Chatterton Hill, elevated terrain off on his right flank, is the key to the whole position. He quickly rushes 2,000 infantry and engineers there under Colonels Joseph Reed and Rufus Putnam, who begin entrenching themselves. British troops
under General Alexander Leslie try and fail to storm the point, and it is not until Colonel Johann Rall&#x0027;s Hessians turn the American right that the defenders fall back. Washington, at this juncture, falls back in good order to strong positions along White Castle Heights. The victorious Howe, meanwhile, is content to simply occupy the battlefield and he fails to mount a vigorous pursuit. American losses are in the vicinity of 150 killed, wounded, and captured; the British sustain roughly twice that.

Worse, the 2,800-man garrison under Colonel Robert Magaw lacks adequate artillery and an accessible water supply, among other things. General William Howe devises a three-pronged assault that hits the post from two different directions: Troops under General Charles Cornwallis and Colonel Hugh Percy have little difficulty overrunning several satellite fortifications, but General Wilhelm von Knyphausen&#x0027;s Hessians are forced to traverse rough, wooded terrain amply guarded by Pennsylvania riflemen. The Germans charge and are thrown back five times with significant losses; in the course of battle, an American woman, Margaret Corbin, takes her dead husband&#x0027;s place at a cannon until being critically wounded. A final charge by Knyphausen stampedes the defenders back inside the already overcrowded fort, and Magaw finally capitulates at 3 p.m. This proves a stinging reverse for the Americans, who lose nearly 3,000 men in killed, wounded, and captives, in addition to stores of supplies and cannon; British and Hessian losses are around 400.

There he learns that Generals Charles Cornwallis and James Grant have massed 8,000 men at Princeton and are rapidly advancing upon him. Rather than retreat again, Washington orders up General Thomas Mifflin&#x0027;s 1,600 militiamen from Bordentown, Pennsylvania, and then addresses men whose enlistments have expired and implores them to remain under arms for at least another six weeks.
<p class = ""><b><i>January 1</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General James Grant arrives at Princeton, New Jersey, with 1,000 men and posts an additional 600 there to guard supplies. Meanwhile, General Charles Cornwallis leads 6,000 Redcoats and Hessians toward Assumpink Creek on the Delaware River, where the Continental army is reportedly lurking. General George Washington is aware of the British approach and dispatches a brigade under Colonel Edward Hand to slow their advance while he entrenches.
<p class = ""><b><i>January 2</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Charles Cornwallis advances upon Trenton, New Jersey, seeking to engage the main body of American troops under General George Washington. En route, he encounters the riflemen of Colonel Edward Hand, who tenaciously resist his advance from the woods. It is 5 p.m. before the British reach Assumpink Creek; Cornwallis, confident he can bag &#x201C;the Old Fox&#x201D; on the morrow, calls off his advance. Washington, however, correctly concludes that the British must have stripped the garrisons at Princeton and Brunswick and makes another bold move to attack them. Leaving behind 400 men to stoke camp fires throughout the evening, he orders his 5,500-man army to slip quietly around the unsuspecting British in camp and march rapidly under the cover of darkness toward their objectives. The ploy, well-executed, works perfectly, and Cornwallis remains unaware of the ruse until well after daybreak.
• Chaplain John Rosbrugh is the first religious military figure slain when he is killed by Hessians in a skirmish near Trenton, New Jersey.
NAVAL: Commodore Esek Hopkins learns that the British frigate HMS <i>Diamond</i> has grounded itself in Narragansett Bay. He resolves to capture it and commands
the sloop <i>Providence</i> and a battalion of militia, trying unsuccessfully to snare his quarry. When the tide rises, the <i>Diamond</i> floats free and escapes; Hopkins is severely criticized for his mishandling of this matter.
MARINES: In their first large action ashore, a battalion of marines under Major Samuel Nicholas successfully defends Assumpink Creek against a Hessian thrust.
<p class = ""><b><i>January 3</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: With General Charles Cornwallis idle before Trenton, the American army under General George Washington surrounds and gradually envelops the British outpost at Princeton, New Jersey. However, advance troops under General Hugh Mercer and John Cadwalader are roughly handled by the British 17th Foot of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood, and Mercer is killed. Suddenly, Washington appears on the battlefield with the main force and sweeps the British away; Mawhood manages to cut himself free, but the bulk of his force is cornered and captured. The victorious Americans then abscond with as many British supplies as possible and march off for the safety of Morristown just as the lead elements of General Charles Cornwallis&#x0027;s army enter Princeton. The British commander assumes that Washington is off to raid poorly guarded New Brunswick and hurries all night in that direction. American losses in this handsome little victory are around 40 killed and wounded; the British lose 400, principally captured.
<p class = ""><b><i>January 4</i></b></p>
MARINES: Major Samuel Nicholas&#x0027;s marine battalion remains in the field by bivouacking at Sweets Town, New Jersey, not far from General George Washington&#x0027;s main encampment at Morristown. A month later they relocate to Morristown to function as artillerymen over the winter.
<p class = ""><b><i>January 6</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General George Washington marches his exhausted but victorious force into the Watchung Mountains and an encampment at Morristown, New Jersey, for the winter. This places him menacingly astride British lines of communication, with the enemy&#x0027;s advance posts now restricted to Amboy and New Brunswick. General William Howe, seeking to avoid further losses, orders his lines compacted in and around New York City.
• The Continental army continues to suffer from slow recruitment, despite new inducements of a &#x0024;20 bonus and 100 acres after discharge.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: In London, Lord George Germain appoints General John Burgoyne to share a joint command of troops in Canada with Governor-General Guy Carleton. At this time, Burgoyne carefully outlines his ambitious strategy for separating New England from the rest of the colonies, thereby crushing the rebellion. He will accomplish this by marching south from Canada with a crack force of 8,000 men and capture Albany, New York. To do so, he will require a second column marching eastward from Oswego and up the Mohawk River to join him. Burgoyne also assumes that independent forces under General William Howe will likewise march up the Hudson River Valley and completely encircle the Americans. It is a viable strategy but contingent upon greater cooperation among senior British leadership than they will be capable of mustering.
<p class = ""><b><i>March 3</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: In a potentially fatal move, Lord George Germain approves General John Burgoyne&#x0027;s three-pronged strategy to win the war.

Nonetheless, General George Washington is sufficiently alarmed by this thrust to dispatch General William Heath there with an additional eight regiments.
<p class = ""><b><i>March 26</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: Lord George Germain finalizes orders for the upcoming campaign season, instructing Governor-General Guy Carleton to turn over the bulk of his forces to General John Burgoyne and assist him in field operations where necessary.

<p class = ""><b><i>April 2</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: General William Howe advises Lord George Germain that manpower shortages preclude an overland advance against Philadelphia, and he proposes transporting his army by sea.

Resistance proves fleeting and, after burning the town, Tryon marches back to his ships via Ridgefield. The next day, they are intercepted by a body of militiamen under Generals Benedict Arnold, David Wooster, and Gold S. Silli- man. Wooster dies in severe fighting, and the British continue marching to their ships. On the third day, Arnold manages to scrape together 3,000 militiamen and attacks Tryon at Compo Beach, pressing him severely until General William Ers- kine breaks the Americans with a bayonet charge. Tryon&#x0027;s raid concludes with a loss of 200 men and without inflicting much harm on the enemy. American losses are 20 dead and 75 wounded.

The Americans have carelessly entered into a defile with high ridges on either side, and are close to panicking. Herkimer, however, is a study in self-control; despite serious injuries, he calmly puffs on his pipe, reorganizes his line, and beats off several determined attacks. After six hours of fighting and heavy losses to both sides, the Indians grow discouraged and withdraw. Oriskany Creek will be one of the bloodiest encounters of the entire Revolutionary War, with American losses totaling 400, the Indians possibly as high as 150.

Unknown to the British, a large body of New Hampshire militia under General John Stark is also headed to the same destination.
<b>Brant, Joseph (ca. 1742-1807)</b>
<i>Loyalist Mohawk chief</i>
Joseph Brant (Thayendaneagea) was probably born around 1742 in New York, a member of the Wolf clan of the Mohawk nation. He spent his youth near the household of Sir William Johnson, superintendent of Indian affairs, was baptized into the Anglican Church, and assumed the Christian name of Joseph Brant. He was well-educated at the Indian school of Reverend Eleazar Wheelock at Lebanon, Connecticut, becoming fluent in English. Brant first saw fighting under Johnson at Lake George in 1755, and in 1763 he also fought on behalf of Britain throughout Pontiac&#x0027;s rebellion. Around this time Johnson married Joseph&#x0027;s sister Molly Brant, further cementing his ties to England. Afterward, Brant assisted the missionary efforts of Reverend John Stewart by translating religious tracts into the Mohawk tongue. Once the American Revolution commenced in 1775, Brant ventured to England with Sir Guy Johnson as his personal secretary.

Mohawk warrior and ardent Loyalist, Joseph Brant continually sought unity among the six Nations of the iroquois. <i>(Fenimore Art Museum, Cooperstown, New York)</i>

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General John Stark, his numbers boosted to 2,000 men following the arrival of Colonel Seth Warner, attacks the Hessian encampment at Bennington, Vermont. He employs an intricate series of double envelopments that strip away Loyalists on the perimeter before driving home on the Hessians&#x0027; main defensive works. Lieutenant Colonel Friedrich von Baum, expecting a friendly reception from Loyalists reputedly in the region, is unprepared for the onslaught but nevertheless fights back dutifully. He engages the Americans for two hours until his ammunition gives out and then, rather than surrender, leads a charge down the hillside with his dismounted dragoons. It is a brave, if futile, gesture, as Baum is killed and the majority of his command captured. For the loss of 30 casualties, Stark kills, wounds, or captures 900 of the enemy, robbing General John Bur- goyne of valuable, trained manpower at a critical time.
There he was feted at the court of King George III, had his portrait painted by Sir Joshua Reynolds, and was commissioned a captain of Indians. He returned to New York fully committed to the British cause, but other members of the Six Nations Iroquois under Cornplanter urged caution and neutrality. But Brant, by dint of stirring oratory, convinced the majority of tribesmen to side with England, and only the Oneida and Tuscarora fought for the United States. In the summer of 1777, Brant commanded Mohawks as part of Colonel Barry St. Leger&#x0027;s column and distinguished himself at the Battle of Oriskany. Here, Indians ambushed and mauled American militia under Colonel Nicholas Herkimer, although both sides lost heavily.
    In the wake of Britain&#x0027;s defeat at Saratoga in October 1777, the Indians had little recourse but to maintain military pressure on American settlements by raiding. Brant personally led or accompanied many such forays, which culminated in the destruction of Cherry Valley, New York, in November
1778. On July 22, 1779, Brant also cleverly ambushed a pursuing militia force at Minisink, nearly wiping it out. On August 26, 1781, his warriors destroyed a body of Pennsylvania militia on the banks of the Ohio River. However, the success and terror of Indian raids prompted a major American counterattack, and in the summer of 1779 General John Sullivan&#x0027;s troops ravaged the Iroquois homeland. Brant also had to resist the moderates like the Seneca Red Jacket, who urged making peace with the United States before all was lost. He nevertheless resumed his destructive raids until the end of the war, which became a time of reckoning for the Six Nations. The victorious Americans appropriated most of their land in New York, forcing Brant to revisit London and appeal for land grants in Upper Canada to settle his displaced people. He spent the remainder of his life helping the Mohawk readjust to a new life in Canada and there founded the first Anglican church for Native Americans. Brant died at his estate on November 24, 1807, a noted tribal leader.

Howe then discovers that the American left flank is not covered, so he dispatches General Charles Cornwallis and 9,000 men to turn it at Chadd&#x0027;s Ford. Meanwhile, a large Hessian contingent under General Wilhelm von Knyphausen demonstrates before Washington&#x0027;s center to distract him. As anticipated, Washington does not notice the turning movement until it is nearly too late. He then dispatches a succession of infantry formations from his center to his left in an attempt to stem the flow. No sooner has this position stabilized than Knyphausen launches a full-scale attack against the newly weakened center, breaks through, and threatens the entire American force. Washington manages to withdraw from the field in good order, although he loses an entire artillery battery in the process. Howe is once again triumphant, having inflicted 1,200 casualties on the Americans while sustaining 600 of his own.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General John Burgoyne orders a full-scale advance upon the American lines at Freeman&#x0027;s Farm, New York. To accomplish this, he draws his army
up into three columns: the right flank of 1,800 men under General Simon Fraser, the center of 1,100 men under General James Hamilton, and the left of 1,000 Hessians under General Friedrich von Riedesel. The entire force must traverse rather hilly, heavily forested land in order to reach its objective, a large eminence on the American left for mounting artillery. The attack kicks off as planned, then stalls as Fraser encounters riflemen and light troops under Colonel Daniel Morgan, who fight them to a standstill. The British center then butts up against the brigade of General Enoch Poor, and a seesaw battle of attrition unfolds. General Benedict Arnold, watching from afar, finally prevails upon General Horatio Gates to commit more troops to the center, and General Ebenezer Learned&#x0027;s brigade charges into the fray. This move forces General William Phillips to march forward with the British reserves and rescue the 62nd Foot from being engulfed. Arnold then disregards Gates&#x0027;s orders and charges forward with additional troops, threatening to crack Burgoyne&#x0027;s center. At this juncture, General Friedrich von Riedesel makes a sudden appearance on the American right, causing them to retreat. The Hessians&#x0027; quick marching saves the day for Burgoyne, who has held the field amid heavy carnage he could scarcely afford. British casualties total more than 500 men, including several regimental commanders deliberately picked off by marksmen. American losses are roughly half that amount. General Fraser, in light of his losses, prevails upon Burgoyne not to renew the attack on the following day.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Judging the moment right, General George Washington masses his army, reinforced to 11,000 men, and strikes at the dispersed British forces of General William Howe at Germantown. He advances in three columns commanded by Generals John Sullivan, Anthony Wayne, and Nathanael Greene, hoping to surprise and overpower the defenders in camp. The attack, aided by a morning fog, commences well and drives the British back in confusion. Washington then hits an insurmountable obstacle-the stone house of Loyalist Benjamin Chew, garrisoned by the 40th Foot under Lieutenant Colonel Thomas Musgrave. The Americans, lacking artillery, waste valuable time trying unsuccessfully to dislodge the defenders, and the brigade of General William Maxwell suffers heavy losses. Washington then decides to bypass the house completely. Further confusion breaks out when the division of General Adam Stephan marches out of line and mistakenly fires into Anthony Wayne&#x0027;s forces. Howe, meanwhile, has collected his infantry and begins counterattacking across the line. The Americans slowly yield the battleground to the victorious Howe, who came very close to being destroyed in detail-one piece at a time.

The British are drawn up into three columns, with their right commanded by General Simon Fraser, the center under General Friedrich von Riedesel, and the left flank held by a single grenadier battalion under Major John Dyke-Acland. All told, Burgoyne possesses only 1,500 men for this perilous operation. As they advance, they are observed by General Horatio Gates who, in a rare moment of initiative, orders a prompt counterattack. General Enoch Poor&#x0027;s brigade closes upon Dyke-Acland&#x0027;s grenadiers, dispersing them, while Colonel Daniel Morgan routs an assortment of Canadians and Indians protecting the British right. Only in the center, where von Riedesel&#x0027;s stout Hessians hold their ground against steep odds, does Burgoyne&#x0027;s strategy appear to be working. The tipping point arrives when General Benedict Arnold, acting without orders, leads General Ebenezer Learned&#x0027;s brigade in a series of successful charges that dislodge the Hessians from several strong points. The gallant General Fraser, valiantly leading the rear guard, is singled out and shot down by rifleman Timothy Murphy, depriving the British of their best tactician. Arnold, meanwhile, gathers up additional troops and attacks the remaining Hessian redoubts; he is wounded in the leg again, but the defenders are routed and flee to the rear. Burgoyne at this moment judges the day lost and orders a retreat, preparing to make a last stand at his grand redoubt. Fortunately, nightfall terminates the contest. The British losses total near 600 men and 10 cannon, while the Americans have lost 200 killed and wounded.

Von Donop forms his men into two columns and then charges the northern and southern faces of the fort.

The Hessians continue attacking bravely until Von Donop is mortally wounded and then finally withdraw. Hessian losses are nearly 500; Greene loses only 35 men.

Friedrich Wilhelm Ludoff Gerhard Augustin von Steuben was born in Magdeburg, Prussia (Germany), on September 30, 1730, the son of an army officer. He joined the famous Prussian army at the age of 17, fought capably, and rose to the rank of captain before being discharged in 1763. Thereafter, Steuben worked for several petty princes in various capacities, especially as chamberlain. Around this time he also began calling himself &#x201C;baron&#x201D; and also affixed the aristocratic title &#x201C;von&#x201D; to his last name, despite a common origin. In 1776 he departed Germany and traveled to France, where American agents were known to be hiring experienced military officers. He presented his credentials to Benjamin Franklin as a late lieutenant general of King Frederick the Great, and Franklin produced a letter of introduction to the Continental Congress. This was despite the fact that Steuben, fluent in German and French, did not speak a word of English. He nonetheless arrived at Portsmouth, New
Hampshire, in December 1777, introduced himself to Congress at York, Pennsylvania, and next found himself at General George Washington&#x0027;s camp at Valley Forge. Washington was impressed by his military bearing and appointed him inspector general. It was in this capacity that Steuben made history by introducing a simplified version of the fearsome Prussian drill system to the ragtag Continentals. Acting as drillmaster-and swearing profusely-Steuben trained a model company by himself, then made its members drillmasters with companies of their own. The system was repeated continuously all winter, and by the time Washington&#x0027;s army emerged from Valley Forge that spring, it exhibited a discipline and efficiency previously lacking. The fruit and genius of his labors were made manifest at the Battle of Monmouth in August 1778 when, for the first time in the Revolutionary War, the Americans proved able to withstand their professional British adversaries in the field.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: British light troops under Colonel Charles Mawhood and Major John G. Simcoe surround and eliminate a militia picket at Quintin&#x0027;s Bridge, New Jersey, inflicting 40 casualties for a loss of one man.
• At Valley Forge, Pennsylvania, Baron Friedrich von Steuben commences his celebrated training regimen to turn men of the rough-hewn Continental army into professional soldiers. He does so by selecting 120 men as a model company and training them thoroughly in his simplified version of the famous Prussian drill until they are completely proficient. The men are then broken up and redistributed to their own units to serve as drillmasters. The entire process is continuously replicated and, by the time the army emerges from its winter quarters, it possesses a discipline and precision heretofore conspicuously lacking. He also instructs the American army to fight in two lines instead of the traditional three, which increases unit firepower. Von Steuben&#x0027;s contributions will prove a major factor in the ultimate American victory.
    Steuben continued performing staff func-tions until November 1780 when, after lob-bying hard for a field command, he joinedthe marquis de Lafayette in Virginia as hissubordinate. However, he failed to distin-guish himself in a war of outposts and, onApril 25, 1781, Steuben was outmaneuveredat Point of Fork and duped into abandon-ing valuable supplies. Despite his lacklusterperformance, Steuben subsequently com-manded one of three American divisions atYorktown, where the war effectively endedin October 1781. He next served as a militaryadviser to Washington until March 24, 1784,when he was finally discharged. Steubenaccepted American citizenship and residedin New York City, where his extravagant life-style drove him into poverty until Congressvoted him an annual pension of &#x0024;2,800.Steuben finally settled down on a farm atRemsen, New York, where he served as pres-ident of the conservative-minded Society ofthe Cincinnati. The self-styled &#x201C;baron&#x201D; diedat Remsen on November 28, 1794, havinginfused the fledgling American army with itsfirst taste of military professionalism.

<b>Lafayette, Marquis de (La Fayette) (1757-1834)</b>
<i>French military officer</i>
Marie Joseph Yvest Roch Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette, was born at Cha- vaniac, France, on September 16, 1757, the scion of one of France&#x0027;s most distinguished families. Orphaned at an early age, he joined the army at 13 and later married into the influential Noailles family. Lafayette seemed destined to enjoy the life of a wealthy nobleman, but he was struck by the idealism of the American Revolution and determined to offer the young nation his services. When his family refused to condone this decision, he chartered a boat for America at his own expense and was subsequently declared an outlaw by King Louis XVI. Lafayette and his faithful friend and mentor, Baron Johann de Kalb, eventually made their way to Philadelphia, where they presented their credentials to the Continental Congress. Whatever the youthful marquis lacked in meaningful military experience he more than compensated for with boundless enthusiasm for the American cause, and General George Wash
ington appointed him to his military family. Lafayette soon proved his worth by fighting valiantly at Brandywine and other severe engagements, sustaining a leg wound. On May 28, 1778, he cleverly outmaneuvered British forces at Barren Hills, Pennsylvania, avoiding a snare set for him by General William Howe. Lafayette then served as a military liaison with the French expedition of Admiral Comte Charles d’Estaing throughout the ill-fated Rhode Island campaign. He returned to France in January 1779, where he was briefly arrested, then released, by the king. Lafayette remained a year in Paris pleading the American cause at the court, and rejoined Washington at a time when American military fortunes appeared at their nadir.
    Lafayette received his first independent command in 1781, when he led light troops in Virginia against the wily general Charles Cornwallis. However, once the British had entrenched themselves at Yorktown, he
pursue the attackers, they walk right into a devastating ambush. The raiders then promptly charge and rout the militia, killing and scalping 227 men. Butler will go on to burn eight forts and 1,000 homes and steal 1,000 head of cattle. The Wyoming Valley massacre is one of the war&#x0027;s biggest frontier atrocities.

securely besieged them until Washington could come down from New York with the main army. Lafayette subsequently commanded a division during the rest of the siege and contributed to the decisive American victory there. He returned to France in December 1781, imbued with a new sense of republicanism, and thereafter championed social and political reforms at home. Lafayette commanded the National Guard during the French Revolution, but was forced to flee to Austria in 1797, and was imprisoned. Napoleon freed him in 1800 and offered him a military position, but he retired as a private citizen. With the fall of the Empire in 1815, Lafayette resumed his crusade for liberty by serving in the Chamber of Deputies. In 1824, he embarked on a sentimental tour of the United States, receiving thunderous applause from a grateful nation. Back home, he served as a tireless advocate of political freedom until his death in Paris on May 20, 1834. Lafayette, a child of privilege, remains an enduring symbol of friendship between France and the United States, and a military hero on two continents.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Major Henry Lee deploys 300 Virginia and Maryland troops to attack Paulus Hook, the last British outpost in New Jersey. This is defended by 350 British and Hessians under Major William Sutherland. Lee carefully reconnoiters his objective beforehand, with the help of noted scout Captain Allan McLane, and detaches 200 soldiers from his 2nd Partisan Corps to do the task. These men are then divided into three groups but, en route, half become lost in the dark and the attack is delayed for four hours. The British sentries are alert and fire upon the approaching columns, but Lee finally manages to get his men over a ditch, through a palisade, and into the fort. The ensuing bayonet attack succeeds in overrunning the garrison, save for 50 Hessians in a blockhouse who refuse to surrender. Lee then withdraws, prisoners in tow and closely pursued by Loyalists under Colonel Abraham Van Buskirk. His retreat is endangered when boats expected to ferry them across the Hackensack River fail to materialize, which adds another 14 miles to the march. The Loyalists finally overtake the exhausted Patriots at Liberty Pole Tavern but are in turn driven off by additional forces under General William Alexander. This sharp little action costs the British 200 casualties and captives to an American loss of 12; the Continental Congress subsequently strikes Lee a gold medal in his honor.

Engagement between the <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> and the <i>Serapis,</i> 23 September 1779 <i>(Naval Historical Foundation)</i>
a 40-ship convoy escorted by two British warships: the new, copper-bottomed 44-gun frigate HMS <i>Serapis</i> under Captain Richard Pearson and the 20-gun sloop <i>Countess of Scarborough.</i> The Americans are assisted by the smaller French vessels <i>Alliance, Vengeance, Le Cerf,</i> and <i>Pallas.</i> Pearson orders the convoy into port, then bravely interposes his vessel between them and the enemy squadron. It is late in the evening before Jones can close with his quarry, and a desperate engagement begins. The creaking <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> and the smartly handled <i>Serapis</i> trade broadsides for several hours in the moonlight, with the Americans getting the worse of it. Suddenly, Pearson loses the headwind while attempting to rake and Jones rams his stern. As the two vessels become snared in each other&#x0027;s rigging, the fighting continues at close quarters for two more hours. Finally, a grenade is dropped down a hatch on the <i>Serapis</i> by Lieutenant Nathaniel Fanning, which ignites an ammunition chest and convinces Pearson to strike. The Americans then board and the British colors are struck by Lieutenant Richard Dale. American casualties are 150 out of 237 present; the British suffer 170. The <i>Countess of Scarborough</i> surrenders to the French 10 minutes later, but <i>Bon- homme Richard</i> is so riddled that it will sink two days later.
• In recognition of having waged one of the stoutest ship-to-ship encounters in naval history, John Paul Jones is made a chevalier of the French Order of Military Merit, while Captain Richard Pearson is knighted by the British Crown.
<b>106 Chronology of American Military History</b>
<b>Jones, John Paul (1747-1792)</b>
<i>American naval officer</i>
John Paul was born in Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, on July 6, 1747, and he went to sea at an early age. A skilled mariner, he commanded his own vessel at the age of 21, but in 1770 he faced murder charges for flogging a carpenter to death. Jones was cleared by an admiralty court, but in 1773 he killed another sailor during a mutiny and fled to Virginia under the assumed name of Jones. When the Revolutionary War commenced, he was living in Philadelphia and received a lieutenant&#x0027;s commission in the Continental navy. Jones first accompanied Commodore Esek Hopkins on a raid to Nassau in the spring of 1776 on board the brig <i>Alfred,</i> then received command of the sloop <i>Providence</i> later in the year. He subsequently completed several successful cruises on numerous warships, and in June 1777 he hoisted his flag on the new 18-gun sloop <i>Ranger.</i> Jones now daringly took the war into English waters by seizing the 20-gun sloop HMS <i>Drake</i> off the Irish coast. He continued successfully
raiding European waters until September 1779, when he accepted command of a former French merchant vessel, which he christened <i>Bonhomme Richard</i> in honor of Benjamin Franklin&#x0027;s famous <i>Poor Richard&#x0027;s Almanac.</i> In truth, this decrepit hulk was so worn down that several weeks of repair were necessary before it was seaworthy. Jones remained undeterred. On September 23, 1779, he engaged the spanking new frigate HMS <i>Serapis</i> under Captain Richard Pearson in one of history&#x0027;s hardest-fought ship-to-ship encounters. The Americans took a pounding from their crack British adversary through most of the nighttime battle, and Pearson demanded that Jones surrender. &#x201C;I have not yet begun to fight!&#x201D; came the forceful reply, and the Americans struggled on until Pearson finally struck his colors.
    Afterward, Jones returned to America commanding the borrowed warship <i>Ariel,</i> then visited France in 1781 to negotiate

In four months he has torched over 40 Indian settlements along with 160,000 bushels of corn. Moreover, he has dislocated many Iroquois Indians, forcing them to spend the winter months half-starved and exposed to the elements. Their discomfiture places an enormous logistical burden on the British at Fort Niagara.

American naval officer John Paul Jones is considered one of the founders of the united states Navy and was the only officer of the Continental navy to receive a congressional gold medal. <i>(Independence National Historical Park)</i>
claims to his numerous prizes. At that time, King Louis XVI made him a chevalier of France and gave him an elaborate sword. The Continental Congress also struck a gold medal in his honor, with Jones being the only Continental navy officer so honored. After the Revolutionary War ended in 1783, Congress began selling off its warships and Jones was forced to look for work overseas. In 1788 he tendered his services to Czarina Elizabeth II of Russia, who made him an admiral, and he won several notable victories over the Turks before losing his command to court intrigues. Jones then retired from active duty and lived in Paris. He died there in relative obscurity on July 18, 1792, and was interred in an unmarked grave. It was not until 1905 that his remains were positively identified and he was reburied in the chapel at the U.S. Naval Academy in Annapolis, Maryland, with military honors befitting a national hero. Along with John Barry, Jones is considered to be a founding father of the U.S. Navy who bequeathed to that service traditions of aggressive leadership and victory.

Unfortunately for the allies, General Augustin Prevost has been informed of their plans by a deserter and stations his best troops there to receive the attack.

The only force to proceed is 1,200 French and Continentals under General Lachlan McIntosh, which charges repeatedly against the Spring Hill redoubt. They are as often repulsed, although Colonel Francis Marion manages to plant his standard on the parapet before being driven off. General Kazimierz Pulaski then leads an ill-advised cavalry charge against British artillery and is mortally wounded. Admiral d’Estaing is himself twice wounded, rallying his men and leading them back into the fray before the effort finally collapses. Combined allied losses are nearly 1,000 while the British sustain only 155 casualties. The French-American alliance, already tenuous, suffers another heavy blow.

It is garrisoned by 500 militia and cavalry under General Isaac Huger, who also guards a large train of supplies intended for the city&#x0027;s defenders. This day, however, a roving column of 1,400 cavalry, accompanied by mounted infantry under Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton and Major Patrick Ferguson, gallop outside the American camp. Pressing forward, Tarleton surprises American pickets and charges directly into Huger&#x0027;s camp. Ferguson then follows up with a savage bayonet attack and the defenders, who fail to make a coordinated stand, are routed. Huger and his usually capable second in command, Colonel William Washington, barely escape. The Americans lose 100 men killed, injured, and taken, along with 200 horses and 42 wagons of supplies captured, to three British wounded. The only remaining communication route out of Charleston, South Carolina, is now closed.

<p class = ""><b><i>May 29</i></b></p>
<p class = "side-heading">Military: British forces under Lieutenant Colonel Banastre Tarleton encounter an American force under Colonels Abraham Buford and William Washington at Waxhaws Creek, South Carolina. Buford, with 300 men of his 3rd Virginia Continentals, refuses an offer to surrender and draws his men up in a single line while his baggage train and artillery leave the field. Though outnumbered two to one, the British commander decides to attack the American left and center frontally while simultaneously turning their right. Buford then erroneously instructs his men to hold their fire until the British horsemen are at 10 paces: this enables Tarleton to reach the single row of infantry intact and crash through it. A wild melee ensues as the troopers begin slashing and sabering the fleeing survivors until Tarleton&#x0027;s horse is killed under him. Enraged British and Loyalists, thinking he has been killed, begin bayoneting several captives before order is restored. Buford&#x0027;s unit ceases to exist, with losses of 113 killed, 150 wounded, and 203 captured. The heavy death toll generates accusations of atrocity and the ominous charge of &#x201C;Tarleton&#x0027;s Quarter&#x201D; is born. The British sustain only three killed and 12 wounded, having crushed the last organized resistance in South Carolina.

Upon entering Bilbao harbor, Haraden runs headlong into the larger 42-gun privateer <i>Achilles.</i> However, he cleverly drops anchor near the shoals, forcing his adversary to approach head-on under accurate gunfire. At length, <i>Achilles</i> is seriously damaged and retreats while hundreds of milling Spanish laud the victors ashore.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Colonel Elias Dayton, commanding the 3rd New Jersey Regiment and some militia, engages 2,500 Hessians and British under General Wilhelm von Knyphausen at Connecticut Farms, New Jersey. The militia perform with surprising audacity this day but are slowly driven back until reinforced by General William Maxwell&#x0027;s Continental brigade. Knyphausen, taken aback by the sheer number of militia flocking to oppose him, assumes he cannot safely cross the Rahway River bridge and withdraws. American losses are 65 men killed and wounded; Hessian losses are unknown, but British general Thomas Sterling is among those slain. Rather than retreat to New York, Knyphausen entrenches at De Hart&#x0027;s Point to maintain a presence in New Jersey.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: Colonel Francis Locke leads 1,200 American militia against a Loyalist force of comparable size under Colonel John Moore at Ramsour&#x0027;s Mills, North Carolina. The Loyalists deploy along the crest of a nearby ridge, which affords them an excellent field of fire, but the Patriots begin infiltrating the woods around their flanks. A stiff fight then ensues between poorly trained amateurs on both sides; the bloody impasse continues until Locke manages to outflank his
opponent. Moore is subsequently routed and flees the field. Both sides suffer 150 casualties apiece in this costly and clumsily managed affair, but the American victory serves to dampen Loyalist enthusiasm for supporting the British.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: A combined British/Hessian expedition under General Wilhelm Knyphausen advances from Elizabethtown, New Jersey, and attacks American positions at Springfield. They immediately encounter stout resistance from the New Jersey militia under General Philemon Dickinson at Galloping Hill Road bridge, which further stiffens upon the arrival of General William Maxwell&#x0027;s Continental brigade. A determined frontal assault fails to dislodge the defenders, so Knyphausen resorts to an enveloping movement. When this maneuver also recoils, Knyphausen simply brings his superior numbers to bear against the regiments of Colonels Elias Dayton and Israel Angell, forcing them back from Springfield. Simultaneously, another British column hits Americans under Colonel Henry Lee defending a bridge on the Vauxhall Road. Again, British numbers prevail and General Nathanael Greene finally orders his men withdrawn to the safety of Short Hills. But Knyphausen, though victorious, is stunned by the extent of American resistance and questions the wisdom of continuing further. That evening, he orders a retreat to the coast and is harried by New Jersey militia every step of the way until the British and Hessians are ferried back to Staten Island. The defense of Springfield costs the Americans around 60 men; enemy losses are unknown but presumed to be in the vicinity of 300.

<p class = "side-heading">Military: General Horatio Gates orders an advance against the important British supply depot at Camden, South Carolina. At the time, he has only a brigade of Delaware and Maryland Continentals under General Johann de Kalb and the mounted Pulaski Legion under Colonel Charles Armand. Moreover, Gates, against the advice of his officers, deliberately chooses a barren, direct route to Camden over a circuitous approach via Salisbury and Charlotte that would entail an additional 50 miles of marching but would take the soldiers though a friendlier, well-stocked region. The path Gates chooses, while shorter, is strongly Loyalist in tenor, barren, and poorly suited for feeding an army already low on supplies.
